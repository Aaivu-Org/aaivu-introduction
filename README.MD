# Welcome to Aaivu organization

Welcome to Aaivu Organization! We do research and projects to help the people with the help of NLP.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

“Aaivu” organization is an open-source organization to enhance and enrich the lives of the community who will benefit from NLP. These are our objectives,

- We engage in NLP based projects to adapt the projects that were done for languages such as English to local languages such as Tamil and Sinhala.
- We use techniques such as word embedding to understand and analyze the languages and implement them in a useful manner.
- We do Data Mining to support these ventures.
Let’s together to contribute.
